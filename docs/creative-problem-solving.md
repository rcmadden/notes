# Creative Problem Solving: Think Like A Programmer
by  V. Anton Spraul

## Strategies For Problem Solving

Thinking about the **problem** can be more procuctive than thinking about the solution.
* If you are unaware of all possible actions you could take, you may be unable to solve the problem
* Restating the problem in more formal terms, we can often uncover solutios that would have otherwise eluded us.
    
    * Try to make operations generic or parameterized 
        1. Operation: Carry the fox to the far side of the river.
        2. Operation: Carry the goose to the far side of the river.
        3. Operation: Carry the corn to the far side of the river.
        
        Becomes:
        1. Operation: Row the boat from one shore to the other.
        2. Operation: If the boat is empty, load an item from the shore.
        3. Operation: If the boat is not empty, unload the item to the shore.
